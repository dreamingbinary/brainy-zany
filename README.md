# brainy-zany
A place where I start documenting the random things I want to learn / dig into when I let my brain wander the interwebs in the wee hours of the night.

The idea is that I track the things with issues, and "resolve them" by commiting my learning in the form of a readme/documentation file linked to the think. Pseudo-blog.
